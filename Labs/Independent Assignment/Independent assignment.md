# Mapping with Style/ Comparison of DNA concentration and SNP data 


### _Introduction_  
 #### _Welcome to my repo for Computational Biology focusing on my independent project_!

Understanding species boundaries is still a hot topic in ecological and evolutionary biology. This opens your eyes to understanding the species niches and trait adaptation. Most importantly, this helps establish what reproductive isolation mechanisms are at play when two closely related taxa are in close proximity to one another. Hybrid zones are the final key in the equation to understanding reproductive isolation between two taxa. If one had the locations of parental species and hybrids then one maybe able to establish the species boundaries and hybrid zone, the first steps in understanding RI. My driving question for this project is to see if I could visually display species boundaries and hybrid zones. 

### _Summary of Data_

I will be working on a dataset that consist of locations, species/subspecies, GPS latitudes and longitudes and DNA concentrations. I will attempt to clean up the data, group the species/subspecies and plot the species ranges and hybrid zones on a map. From here, I will look at another data set and determine if there is a correlation between SNP tables and DNA concentrations of the samples (_mostly added this piece because I didn't know if you would deem the first half difficult enough_) . Both datasets consist of 166 samples. 

As far as I know, the dataset is from a larger grant Dr. Rebecca Safran has been working on that has not yielded any published papers (plenty that are in the works). The grant was meant to look at Whole Genome Sequences of Hybrids and parental species and address multiple biological concepts/questions, for example, speciation, hybridization, evolutionary mechanisms, species boundaries, and more.  I believe in one of the papers that is being published there is a representation of the zones and barriers, but no direction or script was given to me. 

### _Detail Description of Analysis to be Done_

1) Import data to R in a way that allows it to be read properly.
2) Filter the data and remove things that may mess up the analysis.
3) Download any extra ggplot2 packages I may need.
4) Group the species and subspecies together.
5) Figure out how to plot GPS locations using latitude and longitudes.
6) Add snp data to the original dataset.
7) Analyze snp data with DNA concentrations and see if there is a correlation between high DNA concentrations and high SNPs. 

  

_thank you_
