# Repo for lab work in Computational Biology Lab 


### _Hello Friend_!  
 #### _Welcome to my repo for Computational Biology focusing on Lab08_!

Lab08 is about creating a function that solves for the discrete time logistic growth model. This model looks at various factors such as carry capacity, time, growth rate, and initial population size and ask the question " What will this population look like in 5, 10, or even 100 years (depending on how far in the future you would like to simulate). You can simulate the size of the population (abundance) and look at pattern/trend from the simulated data. 
To run the function you simply type Logisticgrowth() and within the parenthesis you add in these factors in this order:
 * r = rate of growth, 
* K = current carry capacity, 
 * gen = the amount of generations you would like to simulate, and
 * initialpop = the current population size.  

The output of the function is a data frame that shows the generations and the abundance for said generation and also a plot of the generations and abundances so you can see the trend. 

I hope this helps you with your ecology or evolution work! 

  

_Enjoy_
