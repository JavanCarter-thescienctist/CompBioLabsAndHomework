Vietnamese Almond Cookies



2 c blanched almonds (chopped fine) – I use a food processer
about 30 whole almonds (to place on the top of each cookie)
¾ sugar [can also just use 1 c sugar and forget the turbinado]
¼ c turbinado sugar (crunchier!)
1/2 c Brown sugar
1 cup (2 sticks) butter at room temperature
1 large egg
2 c flour
1 T baking soda
1 t (and a bit more) salt
1 T almond extract
1 .5T lemon extract

to get everything mixed up, I usually just use my food processer for the entire process and then mix up the last bits in a different bowl to make sure everything is consistently mixed in.

Nuts first until they are finely chopped
Add everything else in order.

The mixture should be quite dense. Form cookies into small balls and then press an almond into the center of each.

Bake @ 350 degrees F for about 20 minutes (check about half way and turn pans around if they are browning unevenly).
